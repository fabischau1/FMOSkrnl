FMOS javascript librarys to help you make your own web os :D
if you need help just look in the info.txt file of the library
for example you can import the kernel library like this <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabischau1/FMOSkrnl/main/Kernel/FMOSkernel.js"></script> but there are also other librarys here

please also read and follow the licence if you want to use the projekt 

have fun ~fabischau1 / fabischau
